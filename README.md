## Quality-In, Quality-Out — RAG Optimizer

This repository implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline**
focused on **grounded, traceable answers** over complex PDF documents.

The project follows the principle of **Quality-In, Quality-Out**:
accurate answers require structured ingestion, explicit grounding, and evaluation.

The system is designed as a **prototyping and evaluation sandbox**, using
open-source components and adapting to real-world constraints
(e.g. no paid APIs, limited resources).


## 🎯 Goals

- Structure-aware document ingestion (text + tables)
- Page-level, human-verifiable citations
- Transparent RAG outputs (retrieved extracts, not hallucinations)
- Automated evaluation design with RAGAS
- Fully runnable pipeline without paid embeddings


## 🧱 Architecture

PDF (WHO)
→ PyMuPDF ingestion (text + tables)
→ Qdrant vector store
→ LlamaIndex retriever
→ Streamlit UI (grounded extracts + citations)
→ RAGAS evaluation (design + integration)


## 📄 Ingestion & Grounding

- Text and tables are indexed separately (`content_type = text | table`)
- Tables are extracted with PyMuPDF and converted to Markdown
- Each chunk carries:
  - `source_document`
  - `page_number`
  - `content_type`

This ensures **explicit grounding and correct citation**.


## 🧠 Embeddings

To keep the pipeline fully runnable without external services, the project uses:

- **HashEmbedding** (custom, offline, deterministic)

This allows end-to-end execution and focuses the exercise on **RAG quality and architecture**, not model access.


## 🖥️ Streamlit UI

- Displays retrieved extracts (TEXT / TABLE)
- Orders results by source page
- Provides:
  - 📄 local PDF download
  - 🌐 official WHO web PDF link (page-level)


## 📊 Evaluation (RAGAS)

- Faithfulness
- Answer Relevance

The evaluation pipeline is fully implemented.
Metric execution requires an OpenAI API key with available quota.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Start required services (Vector Store)

From the project root:

docker compose up -d


This starts Qdrant, used as the vector store.

Verify it is running:

docker ps

2. Prepare input documents

Create the input folder and download the sample WHO PDF:

mkdir -p data/samples
wget -O data/samples/worldhealthstatistics_2022.pdf \
https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/gho-documents/world-health-statistic-reports/worldhealthstatistics_2022.pdf

3. Run document ingestion (Quality-In)

Ingest the PDF with structure-aware parsing (text + tables):

python -m src.ingest


Expected output:

[ingest] worldhealthstatistics_2022.pdf: text_pages=..., tables=...
[ok] Indexed XXX documents into 'docs' at http://localhost:6333


At this point:

documents are parsed,

tables are preserved,

all chunks are indexed with page-level metadata.

4. Query the RAG pipeline via CLI (optional)

You can test retrieval and grounding directly from the terminal:

QUESTION="life expectancy" python -m src.rag_answer


This prints:

grounded text/table extracts

page-level citations

5. Launch the UI (Quality-Out)

Start the Streamlit application:

streamlit run src/app.py --server.address 0.0.0.0 --server.port 8501


Open the URL shown in the terminal.

The UI allows you to:

ask questions,

inspect retrieved chunks (TEXT / TABLE),

verify sources via local PDF download or official WHO web links.

6. (Optional) Run automated evaluation with RAGAS

If an OpenAI API key with available quota is configured:

export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
python src/eval_ragas.py


This computes:

Faithfulness

Answer Relevance

Results are exported to the reports/ directory.

Note: At the time of submission, metric execution may be limited by API quota.
The evaluation pipeline is fully implemented and requires no code changes once quota is available.
